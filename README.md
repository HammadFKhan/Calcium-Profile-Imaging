# Calcium-Profile-Imaging
Calcium profiling in neural signaling events. I focused mainly on developing how to quantify regions of calcium commmunication based on the spatial information. This is particulary powerful if we want to understand where the signals are propogating.
Included in this repository is an ImageJ macro to performn calcium profiling. Just download and drag directly into ImageJ or FIJI to perform the analysis. This is specifically used for spatial profiling of IMAGES not video,
For that analysis, I have included the MATLAB script to analye correlation networks between neurons. The code works with ImageJ data when performing image processing.
